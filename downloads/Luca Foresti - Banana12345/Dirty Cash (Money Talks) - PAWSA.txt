Money talks, money talks

Money talks, money talks

[Post-Chorus]
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh


[Verse 1]
I'm dirty cash, the one that you asked for
I'm wanted by the rich and the poor
More and more, you just can't reject it
And I'm the one that can relate to you
Him, her, and your buddy
'Cause everybody wants some
Money ain't all but, you can't excuse it
The way I'm living, I've got to use it

[Bridge]
I once had pride, now that's all behind
I want to get rich quick
I want success and all that goes with it
And I'm gonna use my sex

[Chorus]
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh

[Drop]
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm
Ooh, ooh, yeah
(Dirty cash, dirty cash)


[Post-Chorus]
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
Dirty cash, dirty cash

[Verse 2]
People are lying in the street
Trying to find somebody to meet
Who'll get them to the top and get them there fast
Trying to get that dirty cash
It doesn't matter, woman or man
Anyone who'll give them a hand
Cash money, that green
Cold cash, that's the scene

[Pre-Chorus]
I've no excuse, I just want you to use me
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you
Do anything you want me to

[Chorus]
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash, I want you
I want your money


[Drop]
(Dirty cash) I want your money
(Dirty cash, dirty cash)
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
Give me your money, ooh, ooh, yeah
I want your money yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Dirty cash, dirty cash)
Dirty cash, I want you
Dirty cash, I need you, oh
